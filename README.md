# Bayesian Data Analysis with Pyro

This repository walks through [Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin.

Bayesian Data Analysis is a great and highly reccomended reading on Bayesian Methods.

[Pyro](http://pyro.ai/) is a universal probabilistic programming language built on top of PyTorch. It's been open-sourced by Uber AI Labs.

This repository is a work in progress, porting examples and some exercises to Pyro. Please open a pull request on the README to indicate interest in a chapter or section!
